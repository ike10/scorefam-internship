Your task for the next 7 days is to develop a simple project management application .
/*Adeyemo*/: 
  You will create the frontend of the application, it will have 3 screens..
  1. The first screen will contain a form that the user will use to create the project. 
  2. The second screen contains every single project that has been created by the user
  3. The 3rd screen contains information about a single project. 

On the second screen, users should be able to filter projects by status, title and date.
When you're done. Host the project on Netlify and send me the link..


/*Victor*/: 
  You will do exactly the same thing, but in your case the application will be blockchain based, you are 
   expected to interact with the blockchain and perform basic crud operations. See if you can host your project on polygon

Subsequently we will all figure out the different ways in which we can integrate both applications together 
In other to have a fully decentralized application.

If there are any questions, keep me posted. Thanks and stay safe
